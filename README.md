Model Training and Tuning with Multiple Datasets

                                              Data Science Model Training and Tuning


Overview
Welcome to the Data Science Model Training and Tuning project! This repository contains an R Notebook that demonstrates the process of training and tuning statistical models using various datasets. From exploratory data analysis to model evaluation, this notebook covers a wide range of topics in data science.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
Training regression and classification models with datasets such as Iris, Boston Housing, and Titanic
Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search
Model performance evaluation using metrics like AUC-ROC and Bland-Altman plots
Comparison of multiple models using resampling techniques and graphical visualizations
Requirements
To run the R Notebook and replicate the analysis in this project, you will need:

R (version 3.5 or higher)
RStudio (optional but recommended)
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine
Open the model_training_and_tuning.Rmd file in RStudio.
Run each code chunk sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
